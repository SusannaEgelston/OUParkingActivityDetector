# OUParkingActivityDetector

## Project Overview
Our product is a website that displays the busyness of OU parking lots based on user reports from students already on campus. It is accessible from personal devices like your cell phone, computer, or tablet.

## Installation Instructions
The user will need a browser that suppports html, css, and JavaScript, which pretty much all modern browsers have. Also they will need an internet connection to connect to the website's server. 


## License 
Our project will utilize the MIT license because we want our project to be open source. We want people to be able to utilize our code at their colleges if they want, but they must mention our license in their code. This will allow our product to recieve more recognition and possible help to find ways to improve our product.
