# OUParkingActivityDetector

## Project Overview
Our product is a website that displays the busyness of OU parking lots based on user reports from students already on campus. It is accessible from personal devices like your cell phone, computer, or tablet.

## Installation Instructions
The user will need a browser that suppports html, css, and JavaScript, which pretty much all modern browsers have. Also they will need an internet connection to connect to the website's server.
