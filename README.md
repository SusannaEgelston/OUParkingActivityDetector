# OUParkingActivityDetector

## Project Overview
Our product is a website that displays the busyness of OU parking lots based on user reports from students already on campus. It is accessible from personal devices like your cell phone, computer, or tablet.
### Project Design
In designing our website, we used Figma to help us visualize everything before beginning to code. Here is a link to our Figma design: https://www.figma.com/design/7xzVwWPrawDq2XzkYjIFGo/OU-Parking?node-id=0-1&node-type=canvas&t=NbpHLHiotIxh6iP0-0.

## Installation Instructions
The user will need a browser that suppports html, css, and JavaScript, which pretty much all modern browsers have. Also they will need an internet connection to connect to the website's server. 

## Usage Guide
The user interface (UI) of the "OU Parking Activity Detector" website is clean, intuitive, and user-friendly, designed to help students find parking quickly and efficiently. The Home Page features a clear navigation bar with Home, About, and Login buttons, and a prominent Get Started button in the center to encourage users to create an account. The login page provides a simple form with fields for username and password, along with options for recovering login details and maintaining a consistent design style. Similarly, the Create Account Page offers input fields for Email/User, Password, and Password Confirmation, along with a Create button to register new users. The core functionality is centered on the Map Page, which displays an interactive map with selectable sections, allowing users to explore different parking areas. A Live Update section provides real-time parking availability updates submitted by other users, enhancing community engagement. The overall color scheme of red and white is consistent across all pages, reflecting the OU brand colors. Clear typography and straightforward navigation ensure a seamless user experience, guiding users through the process of finding parking spots with minimal effort.

## Configuration
No configuring is required for this project. Most browser web versions will be able to handle our project's code.

## Contributing Guidelines
Others can contribute to our project by viewing our code and implementing it however they see fit. However, they must leave a message in their code that shows where our code was utilized. Additionally, users can contribute to our product by leaving reviews and giving us details on any bugs or recommended fixes.

## License 
Our project will utilize the MIT license because we want our project to be open source. We want people to be able to utilize our code at their colleges if they want, but they must mention our license in their code. This will allow our product to recieve more recognition and possible help to find ways to improve our product.
